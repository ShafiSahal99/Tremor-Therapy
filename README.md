Tremor Therapy is an interactive game using developed for helping children and teens with their therapy process for Tremors(Shaky Hands). It is intended to give the teraphist or doctor complete analytics about the ppatients by managing them remotely. Please feel free to start this repo and PR for better changes.


**Motivation**

We were motivated to build this project by the increasing discompforatablility of teraphist and doctors of not able to treat their patients because of the cureent locdown and COVID-19 safety measures. Thousands of children undergoing issue after accidents, brain surgery, parkinson's disease , etc.. are not stranded with no help to continue their recovery exercises. After some research we found that gaming are the most effective way of improving children and teens recovery as it makes the process fun and enjoyable.Thus, We wanted to thus build a gaming system that has some hardware at users(patients) end which can be used by the patient for gaming. The intelligent iot device gets the data realtime and helps the patient place games. This data can be further collected and provided to the doctor/therapist for personal analysis.

**Interfaces**

1)Patient(User): Game developed - game files
2)Doctor/Therapist: Android App for personal patients info and their daily gaming statistics.
